# Wavelet-Transform-LightGBM-NSGA-II
Shield control optimization targeting Cutter wear and SE using wavelet transform, LightGBM and NSGA-II
  1. Noise reduction of raw data using wavelet transforms<br>
  2. Prediction of Cutter wear and SE using LightGBM algorithm<br>
  3. The NSGA-II algorithm was used to optimize with the objectives of wear and SE, and the decision variables were the total thrust of the shield machine, cutter speed, penetration and propulsion speed
